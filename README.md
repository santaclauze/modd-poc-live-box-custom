## Layer customization

### Requirements

Layers should be customizable by user. UX and intuitiveness is important!


### Features
1. Each direction (top, left, bottom, right) should be customizable. 
2. Display "handles" on hover. "Handles" can be clicked and dragged to increase/decrease margin/padding.
3. "Handles" can be double clicked to toggle `%` and `px`.
4. Holding `shift` while draging a "handle" will also increase the opposite side with the same amount.
5. If a `Layer` contains extra `Layers`, the gutter are also customizable (should update all gutters equally)
6. Global 4px snap to grid, prevent snap to grid while holding alt key (does this mean drag and drop?)
